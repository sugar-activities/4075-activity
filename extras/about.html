<p><b>Wikipedia</b> is a
multilingual, web-based, free content encyclopedia project. Wikipedia
is written collaboratively by volunteers from all around the world.
With rare exceptions, its articles can be edited by anyone with access
to the Internet, simply by clicking the <i>edit this page</i> link.
The name Wikipedia is a portmanteau of the words <i>wiki</i> (a type
of collaborative website) and <i>encyclopedia</i>. Since its creation
in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference
Web sites.</p>
<p>In every article, links will guide you to associated articles, often
with additional information. Anyone is welcome to add information,
cross-references or citations, as long as they do so within Wikipedia's
editing policies and to an appropriate standard. One need not fear
accidentally damaging Wikipedia when adding or improving information,
as other editors are always around to advise or correct obvious errors,
and Wikipedia's software, known as MediaWiki, is carefully designed to
allow easy reversal of editorial mistakes.</p>
<p>Because Wikipedia is an ongoing work to which, in principle, anybody
can contribute, it differs from a paper-based reference source in
important ways. In particular, older articles tend to be more
comprehensive and balanced, while newer articles may still contain
significant misinformation, unencyclopedic content, or vandalism. Users
need to be aware of this to obtain valid information and avoid
misinformation that has been recently added and not yet removed. (See <i>Researching
with Wikipedia</i> for more details.) However, unlike a paper reference
source, Wikipedia is continually updated, with the creation or updating
of articles on topical events within minutes or hours, rather than
months or years for printed encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a registered trademark of the nonprofit Wikimedia
Foundation, which has created an entire family of free-content <span
 class="extiw">projects</span>. On all of these projects, you are
welcome to be bold and edit articles yourself, contributing knowledge
as you see fit in a collaborative way.</p>
<p>If you've not done so, we invite you to take a few moments to read
What Wikipedia is (and is not), so that you have an understanding of
how to consult or contribute to Wikipedia. Further information on key
topics appears below. If you can't find what you are looking for, try

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia history</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned
project to produce a free
encyclopedia. Nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and
required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was
slow. During 2000, Jimmy
Wales, founder of Nupedia, and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed to
work
on the project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more
open, complementary project.</p>
<p>On the evening of January
2, 2001, Sanger had a
conversation over dinner with <span class="extiw">Ben Kovitz</span>, a
computer
programmer, in San Diego, California. Kovitz, who
was a regular on "Ward's Wiki" (the WikiWikiWeb),
explained the wiki concept to
Sanger. Sanger saw that a wiki would be an excellent format whereby a
more open, less formal encyclopedia project could be pursued. Sanger
easily persuaded Wales, who had already been introduced to the wiki
concept, to set up a wiki for Nupedia, and Nupedia's first wiki went
online on January 10.</p>
<p>There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors
and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the
wiki format, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and
launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 (now called
"Wikipedia
Day" by some users). The bandwidth and server
(in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis
employees who have worked
on the project include Tim
Shell, one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and
programmer Jason Richey. The domain was eventually changed to the
present wikipedia.org when the nonprofit Wikimedia
Foundation was launched as its new parent organisation, prompting
the use of a .org domain to denote its noncommercial nature. In March
2007, the word <i>wiki</i> became a newly recognised English word.<sup
 id="_ref-0" class="reference">[1]</sup></p>
<p>In May 2001, a wave
of non-English Wikipedias was launched — in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch,
Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese,
Portuguese,
Russian, Spanish,
and Swedish;
these were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian.<sup id="_ref-1"
 class="reference">[2]</sup>
In September,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference">[3]</sup> Polish was
added and further commitment to
the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the
year, Afrikaans, Norwegian,
and Serbocroatian versions were
announced.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia statistics</span></h3>
<p>There are more than <span class="external text">75,000 active
contributors</span> working on some <span class="external text">5,300,000
articles</span> in more than <span class="external text">100
languages</span>. As of today, there are 1,920,980 articles in English;
every day <span class="external text">hundreds of thousands</span> of
visitors from around the
world make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new
articles to enhance the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia.
Visitors do not need specialised qualifications to contribute, since
their primary role is to write articles that cover existing knowledge;
this means that people of all ages and cultural and social background
can write Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>All of the text in Wikipedia, and most of the images and other
content, is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia contributors</span></h3>
<p>Tens of thousands of regular editors — from expert scholars to
casual readers — can edit Wikipedia, an openness that encourages
inclusion of a tremendous amount of content.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out
the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while
maintaining civility. Editors can watch pages and techies can write
editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits. Over 1,000
administrators with special powers ensure that behavior conforms to
Wikipedia guidelines and policies. When a few situations are still
unresolved after all other consensus remedies have failed, a judicial
committee steps in and decides to withdraw or restrict editing
privileges or to take other corrective measures.</p>
<p>Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely
uninvolved in writing and daily operations.</p>

<p>Many visitors come to this site to acquire knowledge, others to
share knowledge. In fact, at this very instant, dozens of articles are
being improved, and new articles are also being created. You
can view changes as they happen at the Recent
changes page. You also can view random articles. Over 1,400 articles
have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles,
exemplifying the best articles in Wikipedia. Another 2,500 articles are
designated as good articles. Wikipedia also has portals,
which organize content around topic areas. You may also search
for articles, using the search box on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>You also might enjoy reading Wikipedia in other languages. Wikipedia
has more than two hundred different languages (see other language
versions), including a <span class="external text">Simple English</span>
version, and related projects
include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific
reference sources, and a news service (see sister projects). All of
these are maintained, updated,
and managed by separate communities, and often include
thought-provoking information and articles which can be hard to find
through other common sources.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Basic navigation in Wikipedia</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. Wherever you
see
highlighted text like this,
it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page
with further in-depth information elsewhere if you need it. Holding
your mouse over the link will often show you where a link will take
you. You are always one click away from more information on any point
that has a link attached. There are other links towards the ends of
most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external web
sites and pages, reference material, and organized
categories of knowledge which you can search and traverse in a
loose hierarchy for
more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary
definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other
languages, and further information available on our sister projects.
You can add
further links if a relevant link is missing, and this is one way to
contribute.</p>

 id="Using_Wikipedia_as_a_research_tool"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Using Wikipedia as a research tool</span></h3>
<p>As a wiki, articles are never
complete. They are continually edited and improved over time, and in
general this results in an upward trend of quality, and a growing
consensus over a fair and balanced representation of information.</p>
<p>Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic
quality from the start, and may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as partisan, and it is after a
long process of discussion, debate and argument, that they gradually
take on a neutral point of view
reached through consensus. Others may for a while
become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some
time — months perhaps — to extricate themselves and regain a better
balanced consensus. In part, this is because Wikipedia operates an
internal resolution process when editors cannot agree on content and
approach, and such issues take time to come to the attention of more
experienced editors.</p>
<p>The <i>ideal</i> Wikipedia article is balanced, neutral and
encyclopedic,
containing notable, verifiable knowledge. An
increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many
already have. However, this is a process and can take months or years
to be achieved, as each user adds their contribution in turn. Some
articles contain statements and claims which have not yet been fully
cited. Others will later have
entire new sections added. Some information will be considered by later
contributors to be insufficiently founded, and may be removed or
expounded.</p>
<p>While the overall trend is generally upward, it is important to use
Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source,
since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in standard and
maturity. There are guidelines and
information pages designed to help users and researchers do this
effectively, and an article that summarizes third-party studies and
assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a name="Wikipedia_vs._paper_encyclopedias"
 id="Wikipedia_vs._paper_encyclopedias"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia vs. paper encyclopedias</span></h3>
<p>Some see clear differences in Wikipedia that allow it to trump
traditional paper encyclopedias. For instance, Wikipedia has not only a
very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding upon material but
also a low environmental impact, since it need never be printed and
then distributed via air, sea, or land. Also, Wikipedia seems easier to
read through its use of wikilinks
instead of in-line explanations and its incorporation of overview
summaries (article introductions) with the extensive detail of a full
article. Additionally, the editorial cycle can be performed with
greater timeliness, accessibility, and ease. Although a paper
encyclopedia is set in stone till its next edition, writers and editors
update Wikipedia at every moment, thus ensuring that it stays abreast
of the most recent events and scholarship.</p>
<p>Supporters of paper encyclopedias disagree. Many think that
Wikipedia's amateur and democratic ethos makes it far more susceptible
to inaccuracy. Others argue that too many Wikipedia articles lack any
real relevance but instead reflect uncritical fandom or advance
hypercritical vendettas. Other charges have been leveled against
Wikipedia: editing can be too contentious and uncivil; articles on
highly important subjects too often lack quality or simply do not yet
exist; it is not user-friendly or welcoming enough to new members; it
is too vulnerable to vandalism, or to distortion by poorly informed or
fringe contributors. However, many Wikipedia members insist that these
problems will largely iron themselves out over the course of the
project; after all, they say, Wikipedia is only in its infancy.</p>
<p><a name="Strengths.2C_weaknesses.2C_and_article_quality_in_Wikipedia"
 id="Strengths.2C_weaknesses.2C_and_article_quality_in_Wikipedia"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Strengths, weaknesses, and article
quality in Wikipedia</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses and differences arise
because it is open to anyone, has a large contributor base, and
articles are written by consensus according to editorial guidelines and
policies. The MediaWiki
software which runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and
changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes", and is
never "lost" or deleted.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is <b>open to a large contributor base</b>, drawing a
large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia
to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other
publications, and makes it very difficult for any group to censor and
impose bias. A large, diverse editor base also provides access and
breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little
documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also
means that Wikipedia can produce excellent encyclopedic articles and
resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their
occurrence.</p>
<p>Wikipedia articles and coverage of topics may have a tendency to
reflect the cultural, age, and socio-economic demographics of its
contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that
"obviously
important" topics are written about, so Wikipedia may contain
unexpected oversights and omissions. While <i>most</i> articles may be
altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain
demographic (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich
enough to afford a computer rather than poor, Christian or Jewish
rather than Muslim or Buddhist etc.) and may, therefore, show some
bias. Some more academic topics may not be covered as well on
Wikipedia, while pop culture topics are covered in great depth.</p>
<p>Allowing <b>anyone to edit</b> Wikipedia means that it is more
easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which
requires removal. While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and
rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint
promotion than a typical reference work. While Wikipedia articles
generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note
that fledgling, or less well monitored, articles may be susceptible to
vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical
openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment,
in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a
controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with
key policies, or may add
information without citable
sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances
that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be
relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are
monitoring recent changes and edits to articles
on their watchlist.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is <b>written by consensus</b> — an approach that has its
pros and cons. Censorship or imposing "official" points of view is
difficult to achieve and almost always fails after a time. Eventually
for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a
neutral point of view
reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and
drawn-out, with articles more fluid or changeable for a long time
compared while they find their "neutral approach" that all sides can
agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by
extreme-viewpoint contributors.
Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, that
allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but also permits
months-long disagreements before poor quality or biased edits will be
removed forcibly.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that Wikipedia is broadly as reliable as <i>Encyclopedia
Britannica</i>, with similar error rates on established articles
for both major and minor omissions and errors.<sup id="_ref-3"
 class="reference">[4]</sup> There is a
tentative consensus, backed by a gradual increase in academic citation
as
a source, that it provides a good starting point for research, and
that articles in general have proven to be reasonably sound. That said,
articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions,
and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly,
this does not always happen. (See for example this
incident in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a
prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as
a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for 4 months, saying
afterwards he "didn’t know Wikipedia
was used as a serious reference tool.") Therefore, a common conclusion
is that it is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point
on its subjects, but like any online source, unfamiliar information
should be checked before relying upon it.</p>
<p>A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these
debates
are probably symptomatic of new cultural learnings which are happening
across all sources of information (including search engines and the
media), namely "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources."<sup

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Disclaimers</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia, in common with many websites, makes its disclaimers
highly visible, a practice which at times has led to commentators
citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable. A
selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded
as reliable (including sources such as Encyclopćdia Britannica,
Associated Press,
and the Oxford English Dictionary) can
be read and compared at Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contributing to Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the <i>Edit this
page</i> tab in an article. Before beginning to contribute however, you
should check out some handy helping tools such as the tutorial
and the policies and guidelines,
as well as our welcome page. It is
important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are
expected to be civil
and neutral, respecting
all points of view, and only add verifiable
and factual information rather than personal views and opinions. "The
five pillars of Wikipedia" cover this approach and are recommended
reading before editing. However, repeated vandalizing will be reported
via the Administrator Notice
Board and the user may be temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Most articles start as stubs,
but after many contributions, they can become featured articles. Once
you
have determined that there is no article on Wikipedia on a topic you
are interested in, you may want to request that the article be
written (or you could even research the issue and write it yourself).
Wikipedia has many on-going projects, focused on specific topic
areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing. The hope of any
contributor is to provide useful and accurate information to others,
and the projects help coordinate efforts.</p>
<p><a name="Editing_Wikipedia_pages" id="Editing_Wikipedia_pages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Editing Wikipedia pages</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to
allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page
design. These include automatic sections and subsections, automatic
references and cross-references, image and table inclusion, indented
and listed text, links ISBNs and math, as well as usual formatting
elements and most world alphabets and common symbols. Most of these
have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has robust version and reversion controls. This
means that poor quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be
reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editors,
so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they
make a mistake in their editing. As there are many more editors intent
upon good quality articles than any other kind, articles that are
poorly edited are usually corrected promptly.</p>

  </dd>
</dl>
<p>The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone
may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any
role they may choose, subject to peer approval. Individuals often will
choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing
articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism,
watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or
similar roles. Editors who find that editorial administrator
responsibility would benefit their ability to help the community may
ask their peers in the community for agreement to undertake such roles;
a structure which enforces meritocracy and communal standards of
editorship and conduct. At present around a 75–80% approval rating
after enquiry, is considered the requirement for such a role, a
standard which tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust and
familiarity across a broad front of projects within Wikipedia.</p>
<p>A variety of software assisted
systems and automated
programs help several hundred editors to watch for problematic
edits and editors. An arbitration committee sits
at the top of all editorial and editor conduct disputes,<sup id="_ref-5"
 class="reference">[6]</sup> and its
members are elected in three regularly rotated tranches by an
established enquiry and decision
making process in which all regular editors can equally participate.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Handling disputes and abuse</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia has a rich span of methods to handle most abuses which
commonly arise, which are well tested and should be relied upon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intentional <i>vandalism</i> can be reported and corrected by
anyone.</li>
  <li>Unresolved <i>disputes</i> between editors, whether based upon
behavior, editorial approach or validity of content, can be addressed
through the talk page of an article, through requesting comments from
other
editors or through Wikipedia's comprehensive dispute resolution process.</li>
  <li><i>Abuse of user accounts</i>, such as the creation of Internet
sock puppets or solicitation of friends and other parties to
enforce a non-neutral viewpoint or inappropriate consensus within a
discussion, or to disrupt other Wikipedia processes in an annoying
manner, are addressed through the sock puppet policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <i>brand new users</i> (until they have established
themselves a bit) may at the start find that their votes are given less
weight by editors in some informal polls,
in order to prevent abuse of single purpose accounts.</p>
<p><a name="Editorial_quality_review" id="Editorial_quality_review"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Editorial quality review</span></h3>
<p>As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic
edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual, and a
variety of positive systems for continual article review and
improvement. Examples of the processes involved include peer
review, good article assessment, and featured articles, a rigorous
review of articles which are desired to meet the highest standards and
showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high quality work.</p>
<p>In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their
own specialized and comprehensive projects,
assessment processes (such as biographical
article assessment), and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus
under projects such as the Neutrality Project or covered
under editorial drives by groups such as the Cleanup Taskforce.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of Wikipedia, it's encouraged that people
looking for information should try and find it themselves in the first
instance. If however you come across valid information missing from
Wikipedia, be
bold and add it yourself
so others can gain from your research too!</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Community discussion</span></h3>
<p>For specific discussion not related to article content or editor
conduct, see the Village pump, which covers such
subjects as news and announcements,
policy and technical discussion,
and information on other specialized portals such as the help,
reference and peer
review desks. The Community Portal is a
centralized place to find things to do, collaborations, and general
editing help information, and find out what's going on.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Contacting individual Wikipedia editors</span></h3>
<p>If you need more information, the first place to go is the
Help:Contents. To
contact individual contributors, leave a message on their talk page.
Standard places to ask policy and project-related questions are the
village
pump, online, and the Wikipedia mailing lists, over
e-mail. You can also reach other Wikipedians via IRC
and instant messenger.</p>
<p>Also, you could try the Wikimedia Foundation <span class="extiw"><b>meta-wiki</b></span>,
a site for coordinating the various Wikipedia projects and sister
projects (and abstract discussions of policy and direction), and there
are many different places for submitting bug
reports and feature requests.</p>
